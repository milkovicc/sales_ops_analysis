# Sales Funnel Optimization & Revenue Forecasting

This project was completed as part of a Sales Operations Analyst technical task. It demonstrates my ability to analyze CRM funnel data, identify performance issues, build reports, and deliver actionable recommendations to optimize sales efficiency and revenue growth.

## Project Overview

**Objective:**  
Analyze simulated sales data to uncover insights across the sales funnel and propose strategies to increase monthly revenue from $50,000 to $60,000.

**Deliverables:**
- Excel file with analysis, visualizations, and funnel metrics
- Slide deck summarizing key findings and action plan

## Files Included

- `sales_ops_analysis.xlsx` â€“ Data analysis, charts, and performance metrics
- `sales_ops_presentation.pptx` â€“ Slide deck with key findings and action plan
- `sales_ops_presentation.pdf` â€“ Exported PDF version of the slide deck

- **Lead Trends by Source (Monthly)**
- **Conversion Rates:**
  - MQL to SQL

## Insights & Recommendations

- Created scenarios using current vs. improved funnel conversion rates
- Proposed an action plan across Sales and Marketing

## Action Plan Highlights

1. Automate MQL qualification to reduce funnel leakage
